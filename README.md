# :notes: Soundly

Soundly is a simple, easy to use music player built for Windows. It provides a minimalistic interface
for adding and customising music. The goal with the design of the app was to reduce choice fatigue, and to reduce time exploring.

Soundly allows you to add music from sources like youtube or your local file system. The songs can be added as a playlist or as an individual song.
